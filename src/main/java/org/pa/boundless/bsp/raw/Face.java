/**
 * The faces lump stores information used to render the surfaces of the map.
 * 
 * There are four types of faces: polygons, patches, meshes, and billboards.
 * 
 * Several components have different meanings depending on the face type.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Face#POLYGON}</li>
 * <li>{@link Face#PATCH}</li>
 * <li>{@link Face#MESH}</li>
 * <li>{@link Face#BILLBOARD}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The lm_ variables are primarily used to deal with lightmap data. A face that
 * has a lightmap has a non-negative lm_index. For such a face, lm_index is the
 * index of the image in the lightmaps lump that contains the lighting data for
 * the face. The data in the lightmap image can be located using the rectangle
 * specified by lm_start and lm_size.
 * 
 * For type 1 faces (polygons) only, lm_origin and lm_vecs can be used to
 * compute the world-space positions corresponding to lightmap samples. These
 * positions can in turn be used to compute dynamic lighting across the face.
 * 
 * None of the lm_ variables are used to compute texture coordinates for
 * indexing into lightmaps. In fact, lightmap coordinates need not be computed.
 * Instead, lightmap coordinates are simply stored with the vertices used to
 * describe each face.
